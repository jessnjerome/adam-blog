<p>
After 7 years together, we've finally decided to make it official and get married!
We'd like to welcome our closest friends and family to Oxford on the 29th of June 2018
for vows, boats and dancing. It'll be mighty craic altogether!
</p>

<p>
We've created this website to put all the important information about the wedding together in one place. 
We'll be updating it with more information as we think of it over the next few months. 
</p>

<p>
We'd be very grateful if you could let us know whether you'll be able to make it by
filling in the form on the <a href="rsvp">RSVP page</a>.
