## By plane

The closest airports to Oxford are London Heathrow and Birmingham Airport. If
flying into Heathrow, take the Airline bus to Oxford from the main bus station
in Terminal 2. This leaves every 20/30 mins and takes about 80 mins to get to
Oxford. Please see the [Airline website](https://airline.oxfordbus.co.uk/timetables/airline-heathrow) 
for further information. Similar services
bus run from Gatwick, Luton and Stansted but Heathrow is by far the easiest.

If flying into Birmingham, you can get the train from the airport to Oxford
Station. This takes about and 1 hour. Please see the [National Rail website](http://www.nationalrail.co.uk)
for planning train travel.

## By car

If you plan to arrive by car, please be aware that unfortunately parking near
the Bodleian is rather limited. If you're not staying over in Oxford, we have a
few car parking spaces reserved at the Perch, so we'd advise driving there
before the ceremony and getting a taxi to the Bodleian from there, so that you
can drive home directly from the Perch after the reception.


If you're driving to Oxford for the weekend and your hotel doesn't provide
parking, you could make use of the [Park and Ride](https://www.oxfordshire.gov.uk/cms/public-site/park-and-ride) 
car parks.

## By boat

If travelling from Ireland, there is a boat service running from either Rosslare-Fishguard or Dublin-Holyhead.
