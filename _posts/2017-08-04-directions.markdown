## By plane

The closest airports to Oxford are London Heathrow and Birmingham Airport. If
you are flying into Heathrow, take the Airline bus to Oxford from the central bus station. 
This leaves every 20/30 mins and takes about 80 mins to get to
Oxford. Please see the [Airline website](https://airline.oxfordbus.co.uk/timetables/airline-heathrow) 
for further information. Similar services run from Gatwick, 
Luton and Stansted but Heathrow is by far the easiest.

If you are flying into Birmingham, you can get the train from the airport to Oxford
Station. This takes about an 1 hour. 
Please see the [National Rail website](http://www.nationalrail.co.uk)
for planning train travel, and make sure that there are trains at the 
required time.

## By car

If you plan to arrive by car, please be aware that parking near
the Bodleian is rather limited. If you're not staying over in Oxford, we have a
few car parking spaces reserved at The Perch, so we'd advise driving there
before the ceremony and getting a taxi to the Bodleian from there, so that you
can drive home directly from The Perch after the reception.

If you're driving to Oxford for the weekend and your hotel doesn't provide
parking, you could make use of the 
[Park and Ride](https://www.oxfordshire.gov.uk/cms/public-site/park-and-ride) 
car parks.

## By boat

If you are travelling from Ireland, there are ferries running between  Rosslare and Fishguard 
or Dublin and Holyhead.
