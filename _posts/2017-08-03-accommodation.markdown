Oxford has lots of hotels to suit most budgets and tastes. We'd recommend
booking early as June can be very busy with tourists. Although fairly
centrally located, the Perch is located down a long winding lane, which means a
taxi will be required to get back to your hotel after the reception. Therefore,
we'd recommend choosing your hotel location based on  distance from the
Bodleian rather than the Perch.

Anywhere in the city centre should be within walking distance of the Bodleian
library, but you may want to [order a cab]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2017-08-02-taxis %}) to get to the ceremony.
