The wedding ceremony will take place in the Divinity School in the Bodleian
Libraries. While the Bodleian is very conveniently located for sightseeing,
it's not so great for parking. If you're staying somewhere central, it should be
possible to walk or get a taxi there relatively easily. If you're arriving by
car, please see the section on "Getting here" for information about parking on
the day.

After the ceremony, guests have the option of either walking to Folly Bridge or
taking the coach from the Bodleian Library. The walk down to Folly Bridge takes
around 25 minutes and is fantastic way to see some of Oxford's most famous
sights, including walking past the Radcliffe Camera, Merton College and Christchurch Meadow. 
However, this is best enjoyed in good weather and comfortable footwear so if preferred, there
will also be coaches taking guests to Folly Bridge from the Bodleian.
